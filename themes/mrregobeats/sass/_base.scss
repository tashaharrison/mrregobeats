 * _base.scss

 * Base styles define the default look for HTML and common Drupal elements.
 *
 * These rules will generally be made up of element selectors for HTML elements
 * such as headings, paragraphs and lists. Common Drupal elements such as form
 * items, collapsible fieldsets and messages should be included in this partial.
 *
 * The styleguide module (http://drupal.org/project/styleguide) gives you a good
 * overview of Drupals common elements for styling. By setting a solid baseline
 * before adding any more specific customisations you ensure that as any new
 * features are added they will be correctly styled without any extra work.
